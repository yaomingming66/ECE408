# ECE408
## ECE408-Applied Paralle Programming Milestone Project
In this final project, you will be implementing and optimizing the forward-pass of a convolutional layer using CUDA. Convolutional layers are the primary building blocks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are used in many machine learning tasks like image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In general, CNNs work well on tasks where the data/input features have some level of spatial relationship.
